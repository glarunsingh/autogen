    "AutoGen offers a robust framework for creating AI-driven systems through various types of agents. Each agent type serves a unique role and can be combined to build complex workflows. In this post, weâ€™ll explore the three main types of agents in AutoGen: ConversableAgent, AssistantAgent, and UserProxyAgent, along with practical examples to illustrate their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ConversableAgent\n",
    "ConversableAgents are designed for structured conversations. They facilitate interactions based on predefined dialogue patterns, making them ideal for tasks that require gathering specific information or following a scripted flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. AssistantAgent\n",
    "AssistantAgents are task-oriented agents that assist with specific tasks, often providing expertise or performing actions based on user requests. They are well-suited for technical support, research assistance, or any task that requires specialized knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. UserProxyAgent\n",
    "UserProxyAgents act as intermediaries between the user and the system. They relay user inputs to the appropriate agents and return responses, ensuring smooth communication across different agents."
