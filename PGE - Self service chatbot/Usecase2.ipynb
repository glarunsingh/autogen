Even though in the consolidated reports the classification is updated based on certain fields from the report, it’s imperative for the process member to verify it in SAP and reclassify it in the report. \\n\\nOnce the blocked MRBR document is classified for all newly arrived documents, it needs to be updated in the DB Directly or through VB tool or through the consolidated report and updating the report again in DB. This implementation is left to the discretion of the configurator and RPA implementation team. \\n\\nOnce the classifications for newly arrived documents are updated in the DB, the fields needs to be referred from the DB and follow-up has to happen accordingly (as mentioned in this document). This process of taking the necessary fields from DB is not covered in this PDD.  \\n\\nThere are few cases in which the initial follow-up email from SAP is sent directly to the concerned users. \\n\\nThere are some cases in which the initial follow up email is not sent from SAP. \\n\\nThis initial follow-up email details is mentioned explicitly in the PDD. There is a new business requirement that all follow-ups should start only after 60 days of due ageing. Hence the first follow-up email should be sent only after 60 days of document due ageing. This is the current business requirement. But this requirement might vary at any point in time and bot needs to be tweaked accordingly. \\n\\nOnce the first follow-up is sent, the second and consecutive follow-ups can be sent in every 7 days interval time. \\n\\n\\n\\nConcepts and Manual Processing\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most important step in processing a newly arrived MRBR blocked document is identifying the issue in the blocked document and the reason for the same. This process is currently done manually and it requires human intelligence to identify and categorize the issue in the document. The process for the same is documented here for knowledge and repository purpose. This process of identifying and categorizing is not in scope of the bot currently as there is OCR dependency for the same. It needs prior approvals from Volvo end to proceed on this. \\n\\nOpen the consolidated report and Filter in column AS status for values “Validated”. These are newly blocked documents that have arrived in on the current day. \\n\\nGet the document numbers for each of these blocked documents to identify the reason for blocking and to classify them further.  \\n\\nLogin to SAP and enter Transaction code – T-code (MIR4). In the screen enter the document number to validate further. Basic checks done here are provided below. Open the invoice copy:  Check the invoice date, posting date, reference number, tax code, currency and the Invoiced and Ordered amount with the SAP fields. \\n\\nCurrently the broad level of classifications (For which an MRBR document is blocked) is provided below: \\n\\nDuplicate confirmation\\n\\nGoods\\xa0 Receipts Not\\xa0 Available - FIFO\\n\\nGoods Receipt\\xa0 Not\\xa0 Available\\n\\nGr booked \\n\\nIncorrect\\xa0 Posting\\xa0 \\n\\nInsufficient \\xa0Fund\\n\\nVCCPRIS \\n\\nZero / One Value GR\\n\\nInvalid Requestor\\n\\n \\n\\nThe explanation for each of them is given below. All these scenarios are for concepts explanation only and it cannot be extended as such to real business problems. There might be variations and dependencies on the concepts explained below.  \\n\\nDuplicate confirmation: \\n\\nIn this case of duplicate confirmation, consider the ordered amount to be 100 and invoiced amount to be 200. In this case, there could be two PO’s that we would have received in system and both of them would be the same amount PO (Same amount PO received twice). One is processed and other is stuck in system. This is categorized as Duplicate confirmation.   \\n\\n\\n\\nGoods Receipts Not Available – FIFO: \\n\\nConsider this scenario, in which there are multiple invoices for a PO.  Let’s consider for the sake of simplicity as two invoices INV1 and INV2 for a single PO. The amounts for each of the invoices are 100 and 300 respectively. Consider both these invoices are posted. \\n\\n There is a GR available in System for let’s say 300. FIFO methodology ensures that this GR is automatically taken for INV1 and it gets cleared. \\n\\nFor INV2, there is no GR that is available in system and hence it is classified manually by processing team as Goods Receipts Not Available – FIFO.  \\n\\n\\n\\nGoods Receipt\\xa0 Not\\xa0 Available: \\n\\nIn Goods Receipt not available case, the Goods receipt is not available in system. \\n\\n\\n\\nGr booked\\n\\nGR booked means, the GR is booked and it will be processed in the next cycle. (In a day or two). No further follow-up is required unless the GR is not proper and it arises further issues. \\n\\n\\n\\nIncorrect Posting: \\n\\nThis classification is currently due to internal team classifying issues wrongly. It doesn’t require follow-ups with users. \\n\\n\\n\\nInsufficient Fund:    \\n\\nFor this classification, the values ordered amount and invoiced amount has to be checked. If the invoiced amount is greater than the ordered amount, it is classified as insufficient fund issue. This will be resolved either by providing an alternate PO for the matching the fund amount correctly.  \\n\\n\\n\\nZero/One Value GR: \\n\\nAfter invoice is posted, if in System when trying to book a GR, in some cases due to system issues, a GR gets booked with value as Zero / One. This is classified as Zero/One value GR. \\n\\n\\nInvalid Requester: \\n\\nThis classification is the case, in which the requester details is not proper and hence sending email to the requester is not possible. One possible solution to this is to get the correct requester details from the Buyer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis complete classification of MRBR blocked invoices has to be performed by team manually. Once the issues are updated in the consolidated report, and it is uploaded in the DB, then the follow up for each of these issues can be performed by bot.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe scope of bot to send follow up emails is covered from Section 5.2 till end of this document.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSelect the blocked invoices which are in overdue status.\\n\\nThe consolidated sheet after the classification update performed by team manually, has to be updated in the SQL DB. \\n\\nThis sheet will be updated by the Exception Handling operations team on a daily basis\\n\\nAccess the DB and get the data from the SQL database. \\n\\nFilter by Column Status as “Validated” \\n\\nFilter the column “Due Date Range” and select the option “Overdue”\\n\\nThe follow-up mails have to be sent to the concerned requestors or buyers, only after they have been blocked for more than 60 days\\n\\nSelect all these columns – Document No, Reference, Crcy, Doc date, Due date, Inv. Pty, Name, Account, Purch.Doc, Due Date Range, Doc Age, Doc Age Range from the DB\\n\\nOnly these fields has to be send in the body of email for follow-ups \\n\\nDrafting the mail to be sent to the approver\\n\\nCompose a new mail from the standard mail box: vccbil@volvocars.com\\n\\nThe email format varies based on the type of classifications. \\n\\nCurrently follow-ups are sent in two ways: \\n\\nManually using email Draft\\n\\nUsing Macro\\n\\n\\n\\nSending follow-ups: \\n\\n\\n\\nEven though there might be multiple classifications for issues, there might be a case in which not all blocked documents requires follow-ups. So the categories provided here below, alone needs to be followed up and others needs to be sent for manual verification. \\n\\nClassification List for sending follow-ups: \\n\\nGR Not Available \\n\\nGR Not available FIFO\\n\\nInsufficient Fund\\n\\nZero/One Value GR\\n\\nDuplicate confirmation \\n\\n\\n\\nThere is an existing macro available to send follow-ups for the below types of classifications: \\n\\nInsufficient Fund \\n\\nG.R Not Available \\n\\nZero/One Value G.R\\n\\n\\n\\nPre requisites for the Macro: \\n\\nThe Invoice Documents for each of the document numbers has to be downloaded from SAP and saved in a pre-determined path in a specific file name to send follow-ups for the three types of classifications: \\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently the Invoice documents are downloaded manually from SAP system and it is saved in a path for the macro to access and send email. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis macro process cannot be reused (as the subject and body of email varies). This macro needs proper tweaking or the entire process can be adapted afresh for the bot. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe email formats for each of the classifications are given below: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGR not Available: \\n\\nSubject of Email: \\n\\nGoods receipt to be booked – Invoice SSSSSS, PO YYYYYY, cost center ZZZZZZ, UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\\n\\n\\n\\nBody of Email: \\n\\nThe goods receipt for the invoice xxxxxxxxx in PO YYYYYY is not yet booked.

There is good scope of automation on this process of downloading invoices and saving it.  \\n\\nOpen the predetermined path where all the invoice attachments are saved. \\n\\nSelect the value from the column “Document No” in the MRBR consolidated sheet\\n\\nSearch for the value in the pre-determined path \\n\\n\\n\\nCopy the invoice attachment that comes up in the search results\\n\\nPaste the invoice attachment in the drafted new mail\\n\\n\\n\\nGrouping of documents for follow-ups:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the email has to be sent to the same requestor / approver for approvals and if there are multiple document for the same requestor / approver, these documents needs to be grouped and sent in a single email. \\n\\nThe attachments for the same needs to be grouped and should be sent in a ZIP format for the same requestor\\n\\nIf the line items for same requestor exceeds more than 10, it needs to be sent as an attachment in a excel format (instead of pasting the same in the body of email).\\n\\nSending the mail to the required stakeholder\\n\\nCopy the entity from the column “Email” and paste it in the recipient dialog box\\n\\nPress “Ctrl +K” to find the mail-id for the stakeholder\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd the standard recipients in the CC dialog box. These details will be provided by the business operations team.\\n\\nFill in the To and CC fields \\n\\nClick on CTRL + K to verify the email recipients \\n\\nClick on Send button to send the email\\n\\nIf the email gets bounced back due to requester details not available or the person would have left the company, then an email has to be sent separately to the process member IDs and lead ID’s in Cc to ensure it needs to be followed up manually. \\n\\nUpdating the follow-up details in the SQL database through the VB tool\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the follow-up are sent, the values of certain fields as mentioned in this document needs to be updated in the DB. The technicalities of this is not covered in this document. This is left to the discretion of the Configurator or RPA implementation team to ensure the values gets updated in the DB properly and hence the future follow-ups happens correctly as expected. \\n\\nOpen the VB tool\\n\\nSelect the entity of the document number\\n\\nSelect the category of the exception as MRBR Park\\n\\nInput the Document number in the “Document number” field\\n\\nOpen the document\\n\\nUpdate the “Status” to Mail Sent\\n\\nUpdate the specific “Follow-up 1 field to the date on which follow-up was sent \\n\\n\\n\\nMapping between DB & Report\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attached excel provides the mapping that is established between the fields that is there in the report and the fields that is present in DB. \\n\\nThe daily reports created needs to be updated in DB on regular basis. The mapping is established with the help of DB and analyst team. \\n\\nImplementation of this is left to the discretion of the configuration/solution implementation team to arrive at a technically feasible solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExceptions\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness Exceptions:\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the attachments have to be downloaded and saved in a particular SharePoint directory. The bot will access the downloaded invoices through their document numbers thus, it is imperative that they have to be saved with the right name as well.\\n\\nThe bot will send mails to the correct stakeholders only if the “MRBR sheet” is updated. Thus, the “MRBR sheet” should be updated before the scheduled run of the bot.\\n\\nThe current mail templates need to be changed so as to allow the bots to read the reply mails from the vendors, buyers or requestors. If the bot is able to read the reply mails after standardisation, then Follow-up columns, status and clearing the invoices in the SAP can be done by the bot itself.\\n\\nThe current process followed to send follow-ups is as per Doc Date range. If the doc date range exceeds 45 days, the first follow-up and subsequent follow-ups are sent. The expected or to be process for following up is with due date range. If the due date range exceeds >60 days and if the status is put as overdue, the first follow-up has to be sent.  This process documented might change at any point in time due to business requirements and changes. \\n\\n The format for sending and receiving group emails (Group by requestor / Approver) is not yet finalized.

Even though in the consolidated reports the classification is updated based on certain fields from the report, it’s imperative for the process member to verify it in SAP and reclassify it in the report. \\n\\nOnce the blocked MRBR document is classified for all newly arrived documents, it needs to be updated in the DB Directly or through VB tool or through the consolidated report and updating the report again in DB. This implementation is left to the discretion of the configurator and RPA implementation team. \\n\\nOnce the classifications for newly arrived documents are updated in the DB, the fields needs to be referred from the DB and follow-up has to happen accordingly (as mentioned in this document). This process of taking the necessary fields from DB is not covered in this PDD.  \\n\\nThere are few cases in which the initial follow-up email from SAP is sent directly to the concerned users. \\n\\nThere are some cases in which the initial follow up email is not sent from SAP. \\n\\nThis initial follow-up email details is mentioned explicitly in the PDD. There is a new business requirement that all follow-ups should start only after 60 days of due ageing. Hence the first follow-up email should be sent only after 60 days of document due ageing. This is the current business requirement. But this requirement might vary at any point in time and bot needs to be tweaked accordingly. \\n\\nOnce the first follow-up is sent, the second and consecutive follow-ups can be sent in every 7 days interval time. \\n\\n\\n\\nConcepts and Manual Processing\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most important step in processing a newly arrived MRBR blocked document is identifying the issue in the blocked document and the reason for the same. This process is currently done manually and it requires human intelligence to identify and categorize the issue in the document. The process for the same is documented here for knowledge and repository purpose. This process of identifying and categorizing is not in scope of the bot currently as there is OCR dependency for the same. It needs prior approvals from Volvo end to proceed on this. \\n\\nOpen the consolidated report and Filter in column AS status for values “Validated”. These are newly blocked documents that have arrived in on the current day. \\n\\nGet the document numbers for each of these blocked documents to identify the reason for blocking and to classify them further.  \\n\\nLogin to SAP and enter Transaction code – T-code (MIR4). In the screen enter the document number to validate further. Basic checks done here are provided below. Open the invoice copy:  Check the invoice date, posting date, reference number, tax code, currency and the Invoiced and Ordered amount with the SAP fields. \\n\\nCurrently the broad level of classifications (For which an MRBR document is blocked) is provided below: \\n\\nDuplicate confirmation\\n\\nGoods\\xa0 Receipts Not\\xa0 Available - FIFO\\n\\nGoods Receipt\\xa0 Not\\xa0 Available\\n\\nGr booked \\n\\nIncorrect\\xa0 Posting\\xa0 \\n\\nInsufficient \\xa0Fund\\n\\nVCCPRIS \\n\\nZero / One Value GR\\n\\nInvalid Requestor\\n\\n \\n\\nThe explanation for each of them is given below. All these scenarios are for concepts explanation only and it cannot be extended as such to real business problems. There might be variations and dependencies on the concepts explained below.  \\n\\nDuplicate confirmation: \\n\\nIn this case of duplicate confirmation, consider the ordered amount to be 100 and invoiced amount to be 200. In this case, there could be two PO’s that we would have received in system and both of them would be the same amount PO (Same amount PO received twice). One is processed and other is stuck in system. This is categorized as Duplicate confirmation.   \\n\\n\\n\\nGoods Receipts Not Available – FIFO: \\n\\nConsider this scenario, in which there are multiple invoices for a PO.  Let’s consider for the sake of simplicity as two invoices INV1 and INV2 for a single PO. The amounts for each of the invoices are 100 and 300 respectively. Consider both these invoices are posted. \\n\\n There is a GR available in System for let’s say 300. FIFO methodology ensures that this GR is automatically taken for INV1 and it gets cleared. \\n\\nFor INV2, there is no GR that is available in system and hence it is classified manually by processing team as Goods Receipts Not Available – FIFO.  \\n\\n\\n\\nGoods Receipt\\xa0 Not\\xa0 Available: \\n\\nIn Goods Receipt not available case, the Goods receipt is not available in system. \\n\\n\\n\\nGr booked\\n\\nGR booked means, the GR is booked and it will be processed in the next cycle. (In a day or two). No further follow-up is required unless the GR is not proper and it arises further issues. \\n\\n\\n\\nIncorrect Posting: \\n\\nThis classification is currently due to internal team classifying issues wrongly. It doesn’t require follow-ups with users. \\n\\n\\n\\nInsufficient Fund:    \\n\\nFor this classification, the values ordered amount and invoiced amount has to be checked. If the invoiced amount is greater than the ordered amount, it is classified as insufficient fund issue. This will be resolved either by providing an alternate PO for the matching the fund amount correctly.  \\n\\n\\n\\nZero/One Value GR: \\n\\nAfter invoice is posted, if in System when trying to book a GR, in some cases due to system issues, a GR gets booked with value as Zero / One. This is classified as Zero/One value GR. \\n\\n\\nInvalid Requester: \\n\\nThis classification is the case, in which the requester details is not proper and hence sending email to the requester is not possible. One possible solution to this is to get the correct requester details from the Buyer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis complete classification of MRBR blocked invoices has to be performed by team manually. Once the issues are updated in the consolidated report, and it is uploaded in the DB, then the follow up for each of these issues can be performed by bot.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe scope of bot to send follow up emails is covered from Section 5.2 till end of this document.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSelect the blocked invoices which are in overdue status.\\n\\nThe consolidated sheet after the classification update performed by team manually, has to be updated in the SQL DB. \\n\\nThis sheet will be updated by the Exception Handling operations team on a daily basis\\n\\nAccess the DB and get the data from the SQL database. \\n\\nFilter by Column Status as “Validated” \\n\\nFilter the column “Due Date Range” and select the option “Overdue”\\n\\nThe follow-up mails have to be sent to the concerned requestors or buyers, only after they have been blocked for more than 60 days\\n\\nSelect all these columns – Document No, Reference, Crcy, Doc date, Due date, Inv. Pty, Name, Account, Purch.Doc, Due Date Range, Doc Age, Doc Age Range from the DB\\n\\nOnly these fields has to be send in the body of email for follow-ups \\n\\nDrafting the mail to be sent to the approver\\n\\nCompose a new mail from the standard mail box: vccbil@volvocars.com\\n\\nThe email format varies based on the type of classifications. \\n\\nCurrently follow-ups are sent in two ways: \\n\\nManually using email Draft\\n\\nUsing Macro\\n\\n\\n\\nSending follow-ups: \\n\\n\\n\\nEven though there might be multiple classifications for issues, there might be a case in which not all blocked documents requires follow-ups. So the categories provided here below, alone needs to be followed up and others needs to be sent for manual verification. \\n\\nClassification List for sending follow-ups: \\n\\nGR Not Available \\n\\nGR Not available FIFO\\n\\nInsufficient Fund\\n\\nZero/One Value GR\\n\\nDuplicate confirmation \\n\\n\\n\\nThere is an existing macro available to send follow-ups for the below types of classifications: \\n\\nInsufficient Fund \\n\\nG.R Not Available \\n\\nZero/One Value G.R\\n\\n\\n\\nPre requisites for the Macro: \\n\\nThe Invoice Documents for each of the document numbers has to be downloaded from SAP and saved in a pre-determined path in a specific file name to send follow-ups for the three types of classifications: \\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently the Invoice documents are downloaded manually from SAP system and it is saved in a path for the macro to access and send email. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis macro process cannot be reused (as the subject and body of email varies). This macro needs proper tweaking or the entire process can be adapted afresh for the bot. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe email formats for each of the classifications are given below: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGR not Available: \\n\\nSubject of Email: \\n\\nGoods receipt to be booked – Invoice SSSSSS, PO YYYYYY, cost center ZZZZZZ, UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\\n\\n\\n\\nBody of Email: \\n\\nThe goods receipt for the invoice xxxxxxxxx in PO YYYYYY is not yet booked.

The technicalities of this is not covered in this document. This is left to the discretion of the Configurator or RPA implementation team to ensure the values gets updated in the DB properly and hence the future follow-ups happens correctly as expected. \\n\\nOpen the VB tool\\n\\nSelect the entity of the document number\\n\\nSelect the category of the exception as MRBR Park\\n\\nInput the Document number in the “Document number” field\\n\\nOpen the document\\n\\nUpdate the “Status” to Mail Sent\\n\\nUpdate the specific “Follow-up 1 field to the date on which follow-up was sent \\n\\n\\n\\nMapping between DB & Report\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attached excel provides the mapping that is established between the fields that is there in the report and the fields that is present in DB. \\n\\nThe daily reports created needs to be updated in DB on regular basis.

The bot will access the downloaded invoices through their document numbers thus, it is imperative that they have to be saved with the right name as well.\\n\\nThe bot will send mails to the correct stakeholders only if the “MRBR sheet” is updated. Thus, the “MRBR sheet” should be updated before the scheduled run of the bot.\\n\\nThe current mail templates need to be changed so as to allow the bots to read the reply mails from the vendors, buyers or requestors. If the bot is able to read the reply mails after standardisation, then Follow-up columns, status and clearing the invoices in the SAP can be done by the bot itself.\\n\\nThe current process followed to send follow-ups is as per Doc Date range. If the doc date range exceeds 45 days, the first follow-up and subsequent follow-ups are sent. The expected or to be process for following up is with due date range. If the due date range exceeds >60 days and if the status is put as overdue, the first follow-up has to be sent.
